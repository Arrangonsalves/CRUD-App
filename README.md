# CRUD-App
CRUD apps are the user interface that we use to interact with databases through APIs. It is a specific type of application that supports the four basic operations: Create, read, update, delete. Broadly, CRUD apps consist of the database, the user interface, and the APIs.

Modern web applications have a user perform at least one of the following operations on a database â€“ creating (new record), read/view (existing records), update (existing records), or delete (a record). Or shortly, CRUD. If you have worked with a database, you have most likely worked with CRUD without realizing.
